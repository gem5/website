## Part 1 Hello World
In part I, you will first learn to download and build gem5 correctly,
create a simple configuration script for a simple system, write a simple
C program and run a gem5 simulation. You will then introduce a two-level
cache hierarchy in your system (fun stuff). Finally, you get to view the
effect of changing system parameters such as memory types, processor
frequency and complexity on the performance of your simple program.
