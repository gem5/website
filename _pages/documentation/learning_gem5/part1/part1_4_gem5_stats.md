Understanding gem5 statistics and output
========================================

In addition to any information which your simulation script prints out,
after running gem5, there are three files generated in a directory
called `m5out`:

**config.ini**
:   Contains a list of every SimObject created for the simulation and
    the values for its parameters.

**config.json**
:   The same as config.ini, but in json format.

**stats.txt**
:   A text representation of all of the gem5 statistics registered for
    the simulation.

config.ini
----------

This file is the definitive version of what was simulated. All of the
parameters for each SimObject that is simulated, whether they were set
in the configuration scripts or the defaults were used, are shown in
this file.

Below is pulled from the config.ini generated when the `simple.py`
configuration file from
[simple-config-chapter](http://www.gem5.org/documentation/learning_gem5/part1/simple_config/)
is run.

    [root]
    type=Root
    children=system
    eventq_index=0
    full_system=false

    time_sync_spin_threshold=100000000

    ...

    [system.membus]
    type=CoherentXBar
    children=snoop_filter
    clk_domain=system.clk_domain
    default_p_state=UNDEFINED
    eventq_index=0
    forward_latency=4
    frontend_latency=3
    p_state_clk_gate_bins=20
    p_state_clk_gate_max=1000000000000
    p_state_clk_gate_min=1000
    point_of_coherency=true
    point_of_unification=true
    power_model=
    response_latency=2
    snoop_filter=system.membus.snoop_filter
    snoop_response_latency=4
    system=system
    use_default_range=false
    width=16
    master=system.cpu.interrupts.pio system.cpu.interrupts.int_slave system.mem_ctrl.port
    slave=system.cpu.icache_port system.cpu.dcache_port system.cpu.interrupts.int_master system.system_port

    [system.membus.snoop_filter]
    type=SnoopFilter
    eventq_index=0
    lookup_latency=1
    max_capacity=8388608
    system=system

Here we see that at the beginning of the description of each SimObject
is first its name as created in the configuration file surrounded by
square brackets (e.g., `[system.membus]`).

Next, every parameter of the SimObject is shown with its value,
including parameters not explicitly set in the configuration file. For
instance, the configuration file sets the clock domain to be 1 GHz (1000
ticks in this case). However, it did not set the cache line size (which
is 64 in the `system`) object.

The `config.ini` file is a valuable tool for ensuring that you are
simulating what you think you're simulating. There are many possible
ways to set default values, and to override default values, in gem5. It
is a "best-practice" to always check the `config.ini` as a sanity check
that values set in the configuration file are propagated to the actual
SimObject instantiation.

stats.txt
---------

gem5 has a flexible statistics generating system. gem5 statistics is
covered in some detail on the [gem5 stats](
https://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/statistics/). Each instantiation of a SimObject
has it's own statistics. At the end of simulation, or when special
statistic-dumping commands are issued, the current state of the
statistics for all SimObjects is dumped to a file.

First, the statistics file contains general statistics about the
execution:

The statistic dump begins with
`---------- Begin Simulation Statistics ----------`. There may be
multiple of these in a single file if there are multiple statistic dumps
during the gem5 execution. This is common for long running applications,
or when restoring from checkpoints.

Each statistic has a name (first column), a value (second column), and a
description (last column preceded by \#) followed by the unit of the
statistic.

Most of the statistics are self explanatory from their descriptions. A
couple of important statistics are `sim_seconds` which is the total
simulated time for the simulation, `sim_insts` which is the number of
instructions committed by the CPU, and `host_inst_rate` which tells you
the performance of gem5.

Next, the SimObjects' statistics are printed. For instance, the CPU
statistics, which contains information on the number of syscalls,
statistics for cache system and translation buffers, etc.
