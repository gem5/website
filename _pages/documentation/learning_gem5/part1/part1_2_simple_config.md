Creating a simple configuration script
======================================

This chapter of the tutorial will walk you through how to set up a
simple simulation script for gem5 and to run gem5 for the first time.
It's assumed that you've completed the first chapter of the tutorial and
have successfully built gem5 with an executable `build/X86/gem5.opt`.

Our configuration script is going to model a very simple system. We'll
have just one simple CPU core. This CPU core will be connected to a
system-wide memory bus. And we'll have a single DDR3 memory channel,
also connected to the memory bus.

gem5 configuration scripts
--------------------------

The gem5 binary takes, as a parameter, a python script which sets up and
executes the simulation. In this script, you create a system to
simulate, create all of the components of the system, and specify all of
the parameters for the system components. Then, from the script, you can
begin the simulation.

This script is completely user-defined. You can choose to use any valid
Python code in the configuration scripts. This book provides on example
of a style that relies heavily on classes and inheritance in Python. As a
gem5 user, it's up to you how simple or complicated to make your
configuration scripts.

There are a number of example configuration scripts that ship with gem5
in `configs/examples`. Most of these scripts are all-encompassing and
allow users to specify almost all options on the command line. Instead
of starting with these complex script, in this book we are going to
start with the most simple script that can run gem5 and build from
there. Hopefully, by the end of this section you'll have a good idea of
how simulation scripts work.

Creating a config file
----------------------

Let's start by creating a new config file and opening it:

```
mkdir configs/tutorial/part1/
touch configs/tutorial/part1/simple.py
```

This is just a normal python file that will be executed by the embedded
python in the gem5 executable. Therefore, you can use any features and
libraries available in python.

The first thing we'll do in this file is import the m5 library and all
SimObjects that we've compiled.

```
import m5
from m5.objects import *
```

Next, we'll create the first SimObject: the system that we are going to
simulate. The `System` object will be the parent of all the other
objects in our simulated system. The `System` object contains a lot of
functional (not timing-level) information, like the physical memory
ranges, the root clock domain, the root voltage domain, the kernel (in
full-system simulation), etc. To create the system SimObject, we simply
instantiate it like a normal python class:

```
system = System()
```

Now that we have a reference to the system we are going to simulate,
let's set the clock on the system. We first have to create a clock
domain. Then we can set the clock frequency on that domain. Setting
parameters on a SimObject is exactly the same as setting members of an
object in python, so we can simply set the clock to 1 GHz, for instance.
Finally, we have to specify a voltage domain for this clock domain.
Since we don't care about system power right now, we'll just use the
default options for the voltage domain.

```
system.clk_domain = SrcClockDomain()
system.clk_domain.clock = '1GHz'
system.clk_domain.voltage_domain = VoltageDomain()
```

Once we have a system, let's set up how the memory will be simulated. We
are going to use *timing* mode for the memory simulation. You will
almost always use timing mode for the memory simulation, except in
special cases like fast-forwarding and restoring from a checkpoint. We
will also set up a single memory range of size 512 MB, a very small
system. Note that in the python configuration scripts, whenever a size
is required you can specify that size in common vernacular and units
like `'512MB'`. Similarly, with time you can use time units (e.g.,
`'5ns'`). These will automatically be converted to a common
representation, respectively.

```
system.mem_mode = 'timing'
system.mem_ranges = [AddrRange('512MB')]
```

Now, we can create a CPU. We'll start with the most simple timing-based
CPU in gem5 for the X86 ISA, *X86TimingSimpleCPU*. This CPU model executes each instruction
in a single clock cycle to execute, except memory requests, which flow
through the memory system. To create the CPU you can simply just
instantiate the object:

```
system.cpu = X86TimingSimpleCPU()
```

If we wanted to use the RISCV ISA we could use `RiscvTimingSimpleCPU` or if
we wanted to use the ARM ISA we could use `ArmTimingSimpleCPU`. However, we
will continue to use the X86 ISA for this exercise.


Next, we're going to create the system-wide memory bus:

```
system.membus = SystemXBar()
```

Now that we have a memory bus, let's connect the cache ports on the CPU
to it. In this case, since the system we want to simulate doesn't have
any caches, we will connect the I-cache and D-cache ports directly to
the membus. In this example system, we have no caches.

```
system.cpu.icache_port = system.membus.cpu_side_ports
system.cpu.dcache_port = system.membus.cpu_side_ports
```

> Another notable kind of magic of the `=` of two ports in a gem5 Python

> connected to the request port.

Next, we need to connect up a few other ports to make sure that our
system will function correctly. We need to create an I/O controller on
the CPU and connect it to the memory bus. Also, we need to connect a
special port in the system up to the membus. This port is a
functional-only port to allow the system to read and write memory.

Connecting the PIO and interrupt ports to the memory bus is an
x86-specific requirement. Other ISAs (e.g., ARM) do not require these 3
extra lines.

```
system.cpu.createInterruptController()
system.cpu.interrupts[0].pio = system.membus.mem_side_ports
system.cpu.interrupts[0].int_requestor = system.membus.cpu_side_ports
system.cpu.interrupts[0].int_responder = system.membus.mem_side_ports

system.system_port = system.membus.cpu_side_ports
```

Next, we need to create a memory controller and connect it to the
membus. For this system, we'll use a simple DDR3 controller and it will
be responsible for the entire memory range of our system.

```
system.mem_ctrl = MemCtrl()
system.mem_ctrl.dram = DDR3_1600_8x8()
system.mem_ctrl.dram.range = system.mem_ranges[0]
system.mem_ctrl.port = system.membus.mem_side_ports
```

After those final connections, we've finished instantiating our
simulated system! Our system should look like the figure below.

![A simple system configuration without
caches.](/pages/static/figures/simple_config.png)

Next, we need to set up the process we want the CPU to execute. Since we
are executing in syscall emulation mode (SE mode), we will just point
the CPU at the compiled executable. We'll execute a simple "Hello world"
program. There's already one that is compiled that ships with gem5, so
we'll use that. You can specify any application built for x86 and that's
been statically compiled.

> **Full system vs syscall emulation**
>
> gem5 can run in two different modes called "syscall emulation" and
> "full system" or SE and FS modes. In full system mode (covered later
> full-system-part), gem5 emulates the entire hardware system and runs
> an unmodified kernel. Full system mode is similar to running a virtual

> not required to instantiate all of the hardware devices required in a

> calls, and thus only models user-mode code.
>
> If you do not need to model the operating system for your research
> questions, and you want extra performance, you should use SE mode.
> However, if you need high fidelity modeling of the system, or OS
> interaction like page table walks are important, then you should use
> FS mode.

First, we have to create the process (another SimObject). Then we set
the processes command to the command we want to run. This is a list
similar to argv, with the executable in the first position and the
arguments to the executable in the rest of the list. Then we set the CPU
to use the process as it's workload, and finally create the functional
execution contexts in the CPU.

```
binary = 'tests/test-progs/hello/bin/x86/linux/hello'

# for gem5 V21 and beyond
system.workload = SEWorkload.init_compatible(binary)

process = Process()
process.cmd = [binary]
system.cpu.workload = process
system.cpu.createThreads()
```

The final thing we need to do is instantiate the system and begin
execution. First, we create the `Root` object. Then we instantiate the
simulation. The instantiation process goes through all of the SimObjects
we've created in python and creates the `C++` equivalents.

As a note, you don't have to instantiate the python class then specify
the parameters explicitly as member variables. You can also pass the
parameters as named arguments, like the `Root` object below.

```
root = Root(full_system = False, system = system)
m5.instantiate()
```

Finally, we can kick off the actual simulation! As a side now, gem5 is
now using Python 3-style `print` functions, so `print` is no longer a
statement and must be called as a function.

```
print("Beginning simulation!")
exit_event = m5.simulate()
```

And once simulation finishes, we can inspect the state of the system.

```
print('Exiting @ tick {} because {}'
      .format(m5.curTick(), exit_event.getCause()))
```

Running gem5
------------

Now that we've created a simple simulation script (the full version of
which can be found in the gem5 code base at
[configs/learning\_gem5/part1/simple.py](https://github.com/gem5/gem5/blob/stable/configs/learning_gem5/part1/simple.py)
) we're ready to run gem5. gem5 can take many parameters, but requires just
one positional argument, the simulation script. So, we can simply run gem5
from the root gem5 directory as:

```
build/X86/gem5.opt configs/tutorial/part1/simple.py
```

The output should be:

    gem5 Simulator System.  http://gem5.org
    gem5 is copyrighted software; use the --copyright option for details.

Parameters in the configuration file can be changed and the results
should be different. For instance, if you double the system clock, the
simulation should finish faster. Or, if you change the DDR controller to
DDR4, the performance should be better.

Additionally, you can change the CPU model to `X86MinorCPU` to model an
in-order CPU, or `X86O3CPU` to model an out-of-order CPU. However,
note that `X86O3CPU` currently does not work with simple.py, because
`X86O3CPU` requires a system with separate instruction and data caches
(`X86O3CPU` does work with the configuration in the next section).

All gem5 BaseCPU's take the naming format `{ISA}{Type}CPU`. Ergo, if we wanted
a RISCV Minor CPU we'd use `RiscvMinorCPU`.

The Valid ISAs are:
* Riscv
* Arm
* X86
* Sparc
* Power
* Mips

The CPU types are:
* AtomicSimpleCPU
* O3CPU
* TimingSimpleCPu
* KvmCPU
* MinorCPU

Next, we will add caches to our configuration file to model a more
complex system.
