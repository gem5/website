## **Overview**
The Trace CPU model plays back elastic traces, which are dependency and timing annotated traces generated by the Elastic Trace Probe attached to the O3 CPU model. The focus of the Trace CPU model is to achieve memory-system (cache-hierarchy, interconnects and main memory) performance exploration in a fast and reasonably accurate way instead of using the detailed but slow O3 CPU model. The traces have been developed for single-threaded benchmarks simulating in both SE and FS mode. They have been correlated for 15 memory-sensitive SPEC 2006 benchmarks and a handful of HPC proxy apps by interfacing the Trace CPU with classic memory system and varying cache design parameters and DRAM memory type. In general, elastic traces can be ported to other simulation environments.

**Trace generation and replay methodology**

## **Elastic Trace Generation**
The Elastic Trace Probe Listener listens to Probe Points inserted in O3 CPU pipeline stages. It monitors each instruction and creates a dependency graph by recording data Read-After-Write dependencies and order dependencies between loads and stores. It writes the instruction fetch request trace and the elastic data memory request trace as two separate files as shown below.

### **Trace file formats**

The elastic data memory trace and fetch request trace are both encoded using google protobuf.

##### **Elastic Trace fields in protobuf format**

Fields    | Discritption
-------------- | -------------
required uint64 seq_num &nbsp;   | Instruction number used as an id for tracking dependencies
required RecordType type &nbsp;    | RecordType enum has values: INVALID, LOAD, STORE, COMP
optional uint64 p_addr &nbsp; 	| Physical memory address if instruction is a load/store
optional uint32 size &nbsp; 	| Size in bytes of data if instruction is a load/store
optional uint32 flags &nbsp; 	| 	Flags or attributes of the access, ex. Uncacheable
required uint64 rob_dep &nbsp;  |   Past instruction number on which there is order (ROB) dependency
required uint64 comp_delay &nbsp;       |	Execution delay between the completion of the last dependency and the execution of the instruction &nbsp;
repeated uint64 reg_dep &nbsp;              | Past instruction number on which there is RAW data dependency
optional uint32 weight &nbsp; | 	To account for committed instructions that were filtered out
optional uint64 pc &nbsp; | Instruction address, i.e. the program counter
optional uint64 v_addr &nbsp; | 	Virtual memory address if instruction is a load/store
optional uint32 asid &nbsp; | Address Space ID

A decode script in Python is available at `util/decode_inst_dep_trace.py` that outputs the trace in ASCII format.

**Example of a trace in ASCII**

    1,356521,COMP,8500::

    2,35656,1,COMP,0:,1:

    3,35660,1,LOAD,1748752,4,74,500:,2:

    4,35660,1,COMP,0:,3:

    5,35664,1,COMP,3000::,4

    6,35666,1,STORE,1748752,4,74,1000:,3:,4,5

    7,35666,1,COMP,3000::,4

    8,35670,1,STORE,1748748,4,74,0:,6,3:,7

    9,35670,1,COMP,500::,7

Each record in the instruction fetch trace has the following fields.

Fields    | Discritption
-------------- | -------------
required uint64 tick &nbsp;   |	Timestamp of the access
required uint32 cmd	&nbsp;    | Read or Write (in this case always Read)
required uint64 addr &nbsp;	| Physical memory address
required uint32 size &nbsp;	| Size in bytes of data
optional uint32 flags &nbsp;	| Flags or attributes of the access
optional uint64 pkt_id &nbsp;  |   Id of the access
optional uint64 pc  &nbsp;     |	Instruction address, i.e. the program counter



The decode script in Python at `util/decode_packet_trace.py` can be used to output the trace in ASCII format.


**Compile dependencies**:

You need to install google protocol buffer as the traces are recorded using this.

```sh

sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev

```

### **Scripts and options**

## **Replay with Trace CPU**

The execution trace generated above is then consumed by the Trace CPU as illustrated below.

![Trace_cpu_top_level](/assets/img/Trace_cpu_top_level.jpg)

The Trace CPU model inherits from the Base CPU and interfaces with data and instruction L1 caches. A diagram of the Trace CPU explaining the major logic and control blocks is shown below.
