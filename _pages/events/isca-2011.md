Call for Participation: ISCA 2011 Tutorial
gem5: A Multiple-ISA Full System Simulator with Detailed Memory
Modeling
Sunday, June 5, 2011 8:30 am
<http://www.gem5.org>
The gem5 simulator is a merger of two of the computer architecture
community’s most popular, open source simulators: M5 and GEMS. The best
features of each simulator have been combined to provide an
infrastructure capable of simulating multiple ISAs, CPU models, memory
system components, cache coherence protocols and interconnection
networks. The gem5 simulation team invites users, developers, and all
other interested parties to participate in a tutorial that will
highlight the key aspects of the gem5 simulator .

The first half of this full-day tutorial will be an organized
presentation focusing on gem5 usage and capabilities. The second half is
intended to be more free form where we will answer audience questions on
specific usage, including modification of the simulator to enable new
features.

Topics to be discussed include:

  - Multiple ISA support (e.g. ARM and x86)
  - Detailed and simple CPU models including “execute-in-execute”
    in-order and out-of-order pipeline models.
  - Cache coherence protocols using SLICC
  - Interconnection network modeling (Crossbar, Mesh, etc.)
  - Checkpointing and fast-forwarding

We look forward to your participation in the gem5 tutorial and hope that
by the end of the tutorial you’ll be able to utilize the gem5
infrastructure in your future research.

Thanks,
The gem5 Simulation Team
