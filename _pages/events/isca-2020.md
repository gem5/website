**Update on the gem5 Tutorial:** The gem5 tutorial will be postponed.
We are planning to hold an online class this summer.
Stay tuned and subscribe to the [gem5-users](https://lists.gem5.org/postorius/lists/gem5-users.gem5.org/) and [gem5-announce](https://lists.gem5.org/postorius/lists/gem5-announce.gem5.org/) mailing list for more information.

## 3rd gem5 Users' Workshop (The first virtual version!)

**Wednesday, June 3rd 12:00 PM – 2:00 PM (EDT/New York), 9:00 AM (PDT/San Francisco), 18:00 (CEST/Brussels), Thu 00:00 (CST/Beijing)**

**Thursday, June 4th 10:00 AM – 11:00 AM (EDT/New York), 7:00 AM (PDT/San Francisco), 16:00 (CEST/Brussels), 22:00 (CST/Beijing)**

The gem5 workshop will bring together the gem5 community to discuss their current work using and improving gem5.
The workshop will include a number of community-contributed talks, and a town hall to discuss the recent changes in gem5 and announcing the first stable version of gem5, gem5-20.

The workshop will be held over two days, June 3rd and 4th, for about two hours each day.
The first day will feature community-contributed presentations and Q&As.
The second day will be a community townhall-style event to gather feedback from the community on the past, present and future of gem5.

[Please register for the workshop via EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/gem5-workshop-with-isca-2020-tickets-105893911540)

*Note: You are not required to register for ISCA to register for this workshop.*

You will receive an email via the registration with details on how to join the interactive Zoom webinar.
Additionally by registering, it will help us track the number of people that will be joining.

### Community contributions

We have 10 exciting contributed presentations.
Each presentation will be available via YouTube about a week before the workshop.
In addition to a video, each presenter has been invited to write a short blog post.
We will be publishing the blog posts and videos ~2/day leading up to the workshop.
We will be providing the links to the blog posts and videos below.

During the interactive sessions on Wednesday June 3rd, the presenters will be available for short Q&A's on their work.
Like the main ISCA presentations, each presenter will have a 10 minute slot to give a quick 2 minute pitch on their work followed by a Q&A.
The agenda for the Q&A is shown [below](#draft-agenda-for-workshop).

### gem5 Town hall

On Thursday June 4th, we will host a gem5 community town hall.
This town hall will begin with an introduction and short keynote from Jason Lowe-Power on gem5-20 and the future of gem5.
Then, we will have a set of discussion topics to solicit feedback from the broader community.

*We want to hear from you!*
Please join the town hall no matter what your experience with gem5 is.
We would love to hear both things that are going well with your gem5 experience as well as what can be improved.
This is an exciting opportunity to be able to *see* and interact with others in the gem5 community!
