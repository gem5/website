We have held a handful of tutorials on M5/gem5s at various conferences. Though
the material in these tutorials can be out of date, the tutorial
materials present a more organized (and in some cases more in-depth)
overview than the wiki documentation. We highly recommend taking a look
at the most recent tutorial as a complement to the documentation on the
wiki.

The slides and handouts are the same material except that the handouts
are formatted with two slides per page.

## ISCA 2020: 3rd gem5 Users' Workshop

[More information on the workshop page.](isca-2020)

The goal of the workshop is to provide a forum to discuss what is going on in the community, how we can best leverage each other's contributions, and how we can continue to make gem5 a successful community-supported simulation framework. The workshop will be a half day in the afternoon on May 30.

Details on how to submit an abstract for a presentation can be found on the [workshop page](isca-2020).

## ICS 2018: Vector Architecture Exploration with gem5

[Vector Architecture Exploration with
gem5](ics-2018)

International Conference on Supercomputing, Beijing (China), June 2018

This tutorial covers the Arm Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) and how to
use gem5 to explore system architecture designs of microarchitectures
implementing SVE.

## ASPLOS 2018: Learning gem5

[Full-day gem5 tutorial at ASPLOS 2018](asplos-2018)

This tutorial covers the basics of building gem5, running it, extending and contributing to gem5, and other advanced gem5 topics.

## Arm Research Starter Kit on System Modeling using gem5

<https://github.com/arm-university/arm-gem5-rsk>

Getting started instructions and an overview of the HPI model.

## ISCA 45: AMD gem5 APU Model

[AMD gem5 APU Simulator: Modeling GPUs Using the Machine
ISA](isca-2018)

This tutorial covers the gem5 APU model in detail. In particular, we
discuss the model's support for executing GPU machine ISA instructions
and the full user space ROCm stack.

## Arm Research Summit 2017: gem5 workshop

[ARM Research Summit 2017
Workshop](arm-summit-2017) covers many
advanced topics in gem5 such as Ruby, Garnet, and SystemC.

## gem5 Tutorial and Coding Sprint at HPCA 2017

[This tutorial](hpca-2017) introduces gem5 topics covered in the Learning gem5 book and paired junior software developers with seniors developers in a coding sprint to add features and bug fixes to the gem5 codebase using Gerrit.

## dist-gem5 at ISCA-44 (Toronto, 2017)

dist-gem5 is a gem5-based simulation infrastructure which enables
full-system simulation of a parallel/distributed computer system using
multiple simulation hosts.

## ASPLOS 22

[Full day tutorial on gem5 at
ASPLOS 2017](asplos-2017)

## HiPEAC Computer Systems Week

This tutorial was held in Gothenburg, Sweden in April 2012. It covers
gem5 although for information about Ruby you should look at the ISCA 38
tutorial. We recorded video of the tutorial which is available
    below.

## ISCA 38

This tutorial, held in June 2011 at ISCA-38, it covered gem5 (the merger
between M5 and GEMS). It was extremely well attended with 65 people
participating.

    difficulties

## ASPLOS-13

This tutorial, held in March 2008 at ASPLOS XIII in Seattle, covered M5
2.0 and included several small examples on creating SimObjects and
adding parameters.
