We are happy to announce the gem5 Tutorial, to be co-located with [HPCA 2024](https://hpca-conf.org/2024/), in Edinburgh.

The gem5 Tutorial will be held and will focus on teaching those new to gem5 how to use the latest version.
It will be "crash course" in gem5 and assume no prior knowledge of using computer architecture simulators.
The tutorial will focus heavily on new features in gem5, such as the [gem5 standard library](/documentation/gem5-stdlib/overview), so may be suitable for those who have used gem5 before but wish to refresh their skills.

Please keep an eye on the [HPCA 2024 event page](https://hpca-conf.org/2024/) for details on registering for this event.
