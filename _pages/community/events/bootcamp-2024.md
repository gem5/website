        We are happy to announce the **gem5 bootcamp 2024!**

        **WHEN: July 29th - August 2nd 2024**

        **WHERE: UC Davis, California**

        The gem5 bootcamp is structured to target two groups:

        * **Junior Computer Architecture Researchers** (early graduate students): The primary goal is to equip junior researchers with essential skills to seamlessly integrate gem5 into their projects. This comprehensive **5-day** bootcamp covers a spectrum of topics, starting from foundational aspects such as setting up system simulations. It then progresses to more advanced topics including the creation of customized components, understanding gem5 statistics, and culminating in hands-on experience with running and modifying simulations that closely emulate real-world systems.
        * **Professionals**: This track caters to professionals seeking proficiency in gem5, with a specific emphasis on development aspects. The tailored **3-day** bootcamp provides a focused introduction, ensuring that professionals acquire the necessary skills to leverage gem5 effectively in their work.

        #### Registration Fees

        The registration fee covers five days of meals, including breakfast, lunch, and an afternoon snack. Additionally, participants will enjoy a reception dinner and a fun evening event, each scheduled on separate days. Students have the option of discounted accommodation on campus.

        #### Agenda
        The bootcamp spans five full days, featuring an engaging workshop focused on learning gem5. The workshop is designed to be inclusive, **assuming no prior experience with gem5**. The goal is to equip participants with a strong foundation in gem5 for conducting advanced research in computer architecture.

        The schedule accommodates both students and professionals. Students are encouraged to participate for the entire five days, while professionals are targeted for a three-day attendance from Tuesday to Thursday. The first day (Monday) is dedicated to introducing gem5 to students and familiarizing them with the environment. Days 2 through 4 cover more advanced aspects of gem5 development. The final day (Friday) focuses on practical exercises, including writing tests and contributing to gem5.

        The workshop will give attendees the opportunity to:
        * Learn how to create SimObjects.
        * Learn how to use the gem5 Standard Library to create simulations.
        * Familiarize themselves with gem5-resources.
        * Understand the gem5 statistics module and how to use it in experiments.
        * Create full system simulations capable of running real-world operating systems and software benchmarks.
        * Network with others in the computer architecture research community.
        * **And much, much more!**

        <!--
        [**Registration**](https://na.eventscloud.com/ereg/index.php?eventid=799532&) **is open!**

        Please use the link provided above to register for the bootcamp.

        There are two registration categories available:
        - *Student* : Select this option if you are an undergraduate, master's, PhD, or postdoc student.
        - *Professional* : Choose this option otherwise.

        For students, registration covers the entire 5-day event. You have the choice to stay in student dorms on campus. A few dorm rooms are still available, so students should register and book as soon as possible to guarantee availability.

        Professionals can opt for either a 3-day (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) or 5-day (Monday - Friday) event. We recommend the 5-day option for those completely new to gem5; otherwise, the 3-day option may be more suitable. If you're unsure, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
