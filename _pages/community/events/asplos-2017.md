Architectural Exploration with gem5

# Abstract

This tutorial will give a brief introduction to gem5 for computer
engineers who are new to gem5. The attendees will learn what gem5 can
and can not do, how to use and extend gem5, as well as how to contribute
back to gem5.

# Target Audience

The primary audience is junior computer architecture engineers (e.g.,
first or second year graduate students, as well as junior engineers) who
are planning on using gem5 for future architecture research. We also
invite others who want a high-level idea of how gem5 works and its
applicability to architecture research.

The tutorial is free to attend (no registration fee required),
registration is required via ASPLOS.

Prerequisites: Attendees are expected to have a working knowledge of
C++, Python, and computer systems.
