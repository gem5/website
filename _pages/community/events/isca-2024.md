title: "ISCA 2024: gem5 Workshop and tutorial"
permalink: events/isca-2024
---

The gem5 Workshop is be an opportunity for members of the gem5 community to give presentations on their contributions to gem5 and gem5-related research.
The 7th gem5 tutorial will be held in conjunction with the workshop.
The tutorial will provide an introduction to gem5 and its use in research and teaching.

### Preliminary outline

We plan for the event to touch upon all major areas of gem5 usage and development and give attendees a solid
foundation in which to carry out research with gem5. Where possible we use this event to promote new gem5 features,
such as “gem5 Workloads” and new features contained within the latest gem5 release. We intend for this tutorial to
conclude with a tutorial on the gem5 GPU models, as this was a common request at previous gem5 tutorial events.
