We have held a handful of tutorials on M5/gem5s at various conferences. Though
the material in these tutorials can be out of date, the tutorial
materials present a more organized (and in some cases more in-depth)
overview than the wiki documentation. We highly recommend taking a look
at the most recent tutorial as a complement to the documentation on the
wiki.

The slides and handouts are the same material except that the handouts
are formatted with two slides per page.

## ISCA 2024: gem5 Workshop and tutorial

[More information can be found on the event's page](/events/isca-2024).

We will be hosting a gem5 Workshop and the 7th gem5 Tutorial at ISCA 2024.

The workshop will be an opportunity for members of the gem5 community to give presentations on their contributions to gem5 and gem5-related research.
The tutorial will give attendees an intensive course crash-course on using gem5 to carry out architecture research.

## gem5 bootcamp 2024

[More information can be found on the event's page](/events/bootcamp-2024).

The gem5 bootcamp 2024 is to be held at UC Davis from July 29th to August 2nd.

The bootcamp spans five full days, featuring an engaging workshop focused on learning gem5. The workshop is designed to be inclusive, assuming no prior experience with gem5. The goal is to equip participants with a strong foundation in gem5 for conducting advanced research in computer architecture.

The schedule accommodates both students and professionals. Students are encouraged to participate for the entire five days, while professionals are targeted for a three-day attendance from Tuesday to Thursday. The first day (Monday) is dedicated to introducing gem5 to students and familiarizing them with the environment. Days 2 through 4 cover more advanced aspects of gem5 development. The final day (Friday) focuses on practical exercises, including writing tests and contributing to gem5.


## HPCA 2024: gem5 Tutorial

[More information can be found on the event's page](/events/hpca-2024).

We will be hosting the 6th gem5 Tutorial at HPCA 2024.

This day-long tutorial will give attendees an intensive course on using gem5 to carry out architecture research.
The course will assume no prior knowledge of gem5 and will cover all major areas of gem5, such as creating SimObjects, handling the gem5 statistics, working with the gem5 standard library, and creating full-system simulations.
New features in gem5, such as the gem5 "suites" and other gem5 standard library features, will also be covered so will be suitable for those who have used gem5 before but wish to refresh their skills.

## ISCA 2023: The gem5 Workshop

[More information can be found on the event's page](/events/isca-2023).

We will be running a gem5 workshop on **June 17th 2023**, co-located at ISCA 2023 in Orlando, Florida.

This will be an all-day event and give members of the gem5 community opportunity to present and discuss their gem5-related contributions, research, and thoughts.
Our goal with this workshop is to provide a space for free-flowing discussions and opportunities for networking.

## HPCA 2023: The gem5 Tutorial

[More information can be found on the event's page](/events/hpca-2023).

We will be hosting the 5th gem5 Tutorial HPCA 2023.

## gem5 Boot Camp 2022

[More information can be found on the official Boot Camp event page](/events/boot-camp-2022)

The first gem5 Boot Camp 2022 is to be held at UC Davis on July 11th to July 15th.
The 5 day event will give early-career researchers an opportunity to learn how to use gem5 in their research.
With the assumption of no prior knowledge, the gem5 boot camp will introduce users to all major areas of gem5, such creating of SimObjects, handling the gem5 statistics, working with the gem5 standard library, creating full-system simulations, managing experiment runs using gem5art, and more.
The event will also given researchers an opportunity to network with others interested in computer architecture simulation.

## ISCA 2022: The 4th gem5 Tutorial and User's Workshop

[More information can be found on the event's page](/events/isca-2022).

We will be hosting the 4th gem5 Tutorial and User's Workshop at ICSA 2022.

The tutorial will give those new to gem5 a "crash course" in using the tool to carry out architecture research.

The workshop will consist of a keynote presentation and a series of 15 minute presentations by members of the gem5 community.

## ISCA 2020: 3rd gem5 Users' Workshop

[More information on the workshop page.](isca-2020)

The goal of the workshop is to provide a forum to discuss what is going on in the community, how we can best leverage each other's contributions, and how we can continue to make gem5 a successful community-supported simulation framework. The workshop will be a half day in the afternoon on May 30.

Details on how to submit an abstract for a presentation can be found on the [workshop page](isca-2020).

## ICS 2018: Vector Architecture Exploration with gem5

[Vector Architecture Exploration with
gem5](ics-2018)

International Conference on Supercomputing, Beijing (China), June 2018

This tutorial covers the Arm Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) and how to
use gem5 to explore system architecture designs of microarchitectures
implementing SVE.

## ASPLOS 2018: Learning gem5

[Full-day gem5 tutorial at ASPLOS 2018](asplos-2018)

This tutorial covers the basics of building gem5, running it, extending and contributing to gem5, and other advanced gem5 topics.

## Arm Research Starter Kit on System Modeling using gem5

<https://github.com/arm-university/arm-gem5-rsk>

Getting started instructions and an overview of the HPI model.

## ISCA 45: AMD gem5 APU Model

[AMD gem5 APU Simulator: Modeling GPUs Using the Machine
ISA](isca-2018)

This tutorial covers the gem5 APU model in detail. In particular, we
discuss the model's support for executing GPU machine ISA instructions
and the full user space ROCm stack.

## Arm Research Summit 2017: gem5 workshop

[ARM Research Summit 2017
Workshop](arm-summit-2017) covers many
advanced topics in gem5 such as Ruby, Garnet, and SystemC.

## gem5 Tutorial and Coding Sprint at HPCA 2017

[This tutorial](hpca-2017) introduces gem5 topics covered in the Learning gem5 book and paired junior software developers with seniors developers in a coding sprint to add features and bug fixes to the gem5 codebase using Gerrit.

## dist-gem5 at ISCA-44 (Toronto, 2017)

dist-gem5 is a gem5-based simulation infrastructure which enables
full-system simulation of a parallel/distributed computer system using
multiple simulation hosts.

## ASPLOS 22

[Full day tutorial on gem5 at
ASPLOS 2017](asplos-2017)

## HiPEAC Computer Systems Week

This tutorial was held in Gothenburg, Sweden in April 2012. It covers
gem5 although for information about Ruby you should look at the ISCA 38
tutorial. We recorded video of the tutorial which is available
    below.
