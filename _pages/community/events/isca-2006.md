Using the M5 Simulator ISCA 2006 Tutorial Sunday June 18th, 2006

## Introduction

This half-day tutorial will introduce participants to the [M5 simulator
system](/). M5 is a modular platform for computer
system architecture research, encompassing system-level architecture as
well as processor microarchitecture.

We will be releasing version 2.0 of M5 in conjunction with this
tutorial. Features new in 2.0 include:

  - Multiple ISA support (Alpha, MIPS, and SPARC)
  - An all-new, execute-in-execute out-of-order SMT CPU timing model,
    with no SimpleScalar license encumbrance
  - All-new, message-oriented interface for memory system objects,
    designed to simplify the development of non-bus interconnects
  - More extensive Python integration and scripting support

Because the primary focus of the M5 development team has been simulation
of network-oriented server workloads, M5 incorporates several features
not commonly found in other simulators.

  - Full-system simulation using unmodified Linux 2.4/2.6, HP Tru64 5.1,
    or [L4Ka::Pistachio](https://www.l4ka.org/65.php) (Alpha
    only at this time... coming in the future for MIPS and SPARC)
  - Detailed timing of I/O device accesses and DMA operations
  - Accurate, deterministic simulation of multiple networked systems
  - Flexible, script-driven configuration to simplify specification of
    complex multi-system configurations
  - Included network workloads such as Apache, NAT, and NFS
  - Support for storing results from multiple simulations in a unified
    database (e.g. MySQL) for automated reporting and graph generation

M5 also integrates a number of other desirable features, including
pervasive object orientation, multiple interchangeable CPU models, an
event-driven memory system model, and multiprocessor capability.
Additionally, M5 is also capable of application-only simulation using
syscall emulation.

M5 is freely distributable under a BSD-style license, and does not
depend on any commercial or restricted-license software.

## Intended Audience

Researchers in academia or industry looking for a free, open-source,
full-system simulation environment for processor, system, or platform
architecture studies. Please register via the
[ISCA 2006](http://www.ece.neu.edu/conf/isca2006) web page.
