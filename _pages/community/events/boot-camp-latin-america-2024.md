We are excited to announce that we are bringing the gem5 bootcamp series to Latin America.
The event will take place **November 25th-November 30th** at the University of Buenos Aires, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
In this workshop you are going to learn about processor simulators in general, specifically about gem5, how to run experiments on top of the simulator, and all the amazing research you can do using processor simulators.
The bootcamp will span several full days, featuring an engaging workshop focused on learning gem5.
The workshop is designed to be inclusive, assuming no prior experience with gem5.
The goal is to equip participants with a strong foundation in gem5 for conducting advanced research in computer architecture.
If you are considering attending, please fill out the [interest form]() so that we can plan accordingly.

**This event is free for all accepted attendees**.

## What should attendees expect?

There will be 5 full days of workshop activities centered around learning gem5.
The workshop will start with the assumption of no prior experience using gem5 and aims to go give attendees a solid and broad foundation of knowledge of gem5 in carrying out computer architecture research.

The workshop will give attendees the opportunity to:

* Learn how to use gem5 for research.
* Configure and extend elements of the gem5 standard library.
* Learn how to create new SimObjects.
* Understand the gem5 statistics module and how to use it in your experiments.
* Create full system simulations capable of running real-world operating systems and software benchmarks.
* Network with others in the computer architecture research community.

## Who can attend?

Anyone can apply though, as spaces are limited, preference will be given to early career researchers (e.g., senior undergraduates, first or second year PhD students, and masters students).

## Information for attendees

TBD
